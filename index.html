  <h1>Krampus</h1>
</head>
        
<p> Santa’s worse half is a hairy, devil-like creature called Krampus. Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children,
Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said
that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria
and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.
