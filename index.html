  <h2>Krampus</h2>
</head>
        
<h3>
    Santa’s worse half is a hairy, devil-like creature called Krampus. Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children,
Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said
that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria
and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.

    <h3> 
    The New Year, also called Lunar New Year and celebrated in many countries outside China, starts on the second new moon 
    after the winter solstice. The exact date varies from year to year, but it always falls during the winter. In China, the holiday
    lasts for weeks!Celebrations for Chinese New Year take all kinds of forms, from enormous public fireworks displays and exciting 
    lion dances to special family dinners at home and giving children money in red envelopes for good luck. This vibrant, thriving 
    holiday with ancient roots brings warmth and cheer to winter every year!

        <h2>Dead Horse Caroling</h2>
    </head>
    
    <h3>
        You’re probably familiar with Christmas caroling, but you’re definitely not familiar with the carolers who might show up at your door in Wales.
At some point in December or January, you could open your door to find someone hidden by a ribbon and bell-adorned sheet, holding up a real horse
skull on a stick, with a few fellow revelers in tow. As part of this Mari Lwyd (“Gray Mare”) tradition, the group will sing to you and then challenge
you to a battle of rhyming insults in Welsh (called a pwnco). After the contest, the party is usually invited inside for refreshments.
